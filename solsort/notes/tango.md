# Tango notes

## Reminders

- Connecting, following and feeling the step of the woman
- Focus energy from the center
- Hipconnection

## Navigation

- do not stop the flow, - if there is space in front of you, take it
- try keeping your lane
- never step against the direction of dance, not even when there are nobody there.
- close embrace saves space :)
- no high boleos, or fancy step show-off :)
